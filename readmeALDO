Missing stuff:
1. Additional menu. Free to do it however u want. Can be done in the same OLED as visualizer w/ states or can be done
in the other OLED (cool). Additional menu can include paused/playing icon + volume bar. Maybe even a song timer showing
song length is and its progress (difficult!). idk man do whatever floats ur boat i dont care. jus make it look nice.
2. Volume system. Idk how you will do this I don't even know if its feasible to do it with a buzzer but hey whatever man.
3. Any other functionality u can think of. Maybe add cool LED effect or smth idk. Perchance.
4. For your knowledge, the following components do not have any functionality yet:
- 2 buttons
- 0.96 OLED screen. Btw this uses SSD1306 library.
- UP/DOWN of joystick
5. I FORGOT, MAKE LCD SONG NAME SCROLL.
